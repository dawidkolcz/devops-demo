= Devops demo

Simple devops demo showing usage of docker, and few services.

== Requirements

- Linux - as long as there is bash it should work. You can run it on Windows too, but it's not tested.
- Docker - is a must, get it https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[here].
- Docker compose - optional, but can be used to easily start demo. Get one https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[here].

== What's inside

- Database - PostgresSQL database, very simple 5 items.
- Spring backend - just one REST, only get all works as demo.
- Typescript frontend - used to fetch data from backend. It is served via nginx.
- Jenkins - to show CI/CD

== How to start

If you are running Linux, you can start `./start-demo.sh` and choose your way of running.
Otherwise, you can use docker-compose or just docker to run it.
All modules have their respective script to build and run docker images.
